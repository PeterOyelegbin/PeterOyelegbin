👋 Hi, I’m @PeterOyelegbin

🪪 As a Support & Cloud Operations Engineer with over 3 years of experience helping organizations optimize IT operations, automate their infrastructure, and enhance system reliability. My passion lies in cloud-native solutions, infrastructure automation, and end-to-end IT support.

💼 I have developed cloud-native applications that increased operational efficiency by 40%, created automation scripts that eliminated manual errors, implemented CI/CD pipelines that reduced deployment time by half, and maintained 99.9% uptime by proactively managing networks, firewalls, and systems. My unique strength is a holistic perspective built from hands-on Tech Support, combined with expertise in AWS cloud operations and Django API development. This allows me to not only architect solutions but also deeply understand their operational impact and reliability needs.

📌 Key Skills: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, IAM, SNS, VPC) | Terraform | Ansible | Docker | GitHub Actions (CI/CD) | Python (Django) | Linux | Windows Server | Networking | Troubleshooting | IT Support

🔭 I am currently engaged in developing an E-Voting Web App to improve Nigeria's electoral process.

🌱 I am currently enhancing my Cloud Engineering skills with AltSchool.

💞️ I am actively seeking opportunities as a Cloud/DevOps Engineer or API Developer where I can apply my skills in development, automation, and cloud infrastructure to tackle complex challenges and drive business growth.

📫 If you're looking for someone who can bridge IT support, DevOps, and cloud engineering while delivering measurable impact, feel free to reach me @ peteroyelegbin@gmail.com
