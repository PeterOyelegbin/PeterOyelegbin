👋 Hi, I’m @PeterOyelegbin

🪪 As a cloud API developer, I am passionate about creating efficient APIs and integrating cloud services, especially with AWS. I specialize in automating deployments and optimizing serverless solutions. With over three years of experience in backend development using Django and FastAPI, I have strong proficiency in deploying applications that utilize VPC, EC2, ECS, Lambda, S3, RDS, and more. My problem-solving mindset drives me to effectively optimize both cloud performance and costs.

💼 At Alert Microfinance Bank, I design secure APIs, enhance database performance, and implement AWS cloud solutions. My efforts have streamlined loan processing by 40% and improved scalability for real estate platforms during my time at ELBIS Homes.

📌 Key Skills: Python | AWS (VPC, EC2, ECS, Lambda, S3, RDS, SNS) | Django/FastAPI | RESTful APIs | Serverless Architecture | DevOps (Terraform, Docker) | Database Optimization

🔭 I am currently engaged in developing an E-Voting Web App to improve Nigeria's electoral process.

🌱 I am currently exploring Cloud Engineering with AltSchool.

💞️ I am eager to join cloud-first engineering teams in Cloud Development, Backend Engineering, or DevOps.

📫 I welcome connections with like-minded professionals to discuss technology, backend development, and cloud computing. Feel free to reach me @ peteroyelegbin@gmail.com
